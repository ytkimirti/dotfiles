# dotfiles
My personal configuration files for:
- nvim using [nvchad](https://nvchad.github.io/) 
- tmux
- fish
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- kitty
- iterm

And some scripts I use.

They are _pretty_ messy, so I don't really recommend checking them out, but hey. Nothing is holding you

# Usage

It will probably only work on MacOS, and it might overwrite some of your config files.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:ytkimirti/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
bash install.sh
```
